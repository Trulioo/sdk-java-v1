**address1** | **String** | Address1 is available in certain countries. It can be used to pass a compiled address field instead of sending individual address attributes (such as UnitNumber, BuidlingNumber, BuildingName, StreetName and StreetType).   GlobalGateway will provide a pass through of Address1 directly to connected datasources for the selected country.   Please note: each datasource requires the address fields to be configured in a certain manner, implementing and sending Address1 instead of individual address fields may affect your ability to verify this address. |  [optional]
