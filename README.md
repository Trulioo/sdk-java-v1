# Trulioo SDK for Java #

## Version 1.0.0

The Trulioo Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java contains library code designed to enable developers to customize the integration of GlobalGateway into your automated business processes or website.

Trulioo is a leading global ID verification company providing advanced analytics based on traditional information such as public records, credit files and government data as well as alternative sources including social login providers, ad networks, mobile applications, e-commerce websites and social networks. Trulioo specializes in scoring online identities as authentic, machine generated or fraudulent with our identity bureau covering 4 billion people in over 40 countries, including coverage for the most challenging demographics from emerging markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil.

Trulioo enables increased trust and safety online by powering fraud prevention and compliance systems for hundreds of clients including governments, eCommerce merchants, financial services, insurance, health, and travel companies.

Below is an example of initializing the Trulioo API client and test authentication:

```java
import com.trulioo.normalizedapi.*;
import com.trulioo.normalizedapi.api.*;
import com.trulioo.normalizedapi.model.*;

//Set client here
ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient();
apiClient.setUsername("-- USER NAME --");
apiClient.setPassword("-- PASSWORD --");

//ConnectionApi
ConnectionApi connectionClient = new ConnectionApi(apiClient);

/testAuthentication
String testResult = connectionClient.testAuthentication();
System.out.println(testResult);
        
//testAuthenticationAsync
connectionClient.testAuthenticationAsync(new ApiCallback<String>() {
	@Override
	public void onFailure(ApiException ae, int i, Map<String, List<String>> map) {
		Logger.getLogger(SdkJavaV1Sample.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ae);
	}
	
	@Override
	public void onSuccess(String t, int i, Map<String, List<String>> map) {
		System.out.println(t);
	}
	
	@Override
	public void onUploadProgress(long l, long l1, boolean bln) {
		//To change body of generated methods, choose Tools | Templates.
	}
	
	@Override
	public void onDownloadProgress(long l, long l1, boolean bln) {
		//To change body of generated methods, choose Tools | Templates.
	}
});

```
