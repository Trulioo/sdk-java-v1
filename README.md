# Trulioo SDK for Java #

## Version 1.0.4

### Introduction

Trulioo provides a collection of API methods to help you build business processes powered by the GlobalGateway Normalized API. The Normalized API is a loosely coupled API; fields may be added to our services and responses as the API evolves, and a client must be able to safely ignore fields and data that are not expected. The GlobalGateway Normalized API can help automate your business processes by performing the following tasks:

#### Identity Verification

Electronic identity verification (eIDV) was created specifically to help your business comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) rules and has since evolved to support a diverse range of international electronic identity verification requirements.

#### Document Verification

ID Document Verification analyzes, verifies, and authenticates 3,500 different types of identity documents from nearly every country in the world. The combination of eIDV and ID Document Verification during the Customer Due Diligence check can assist your business in meeting your AML, KYC and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) compliance requirements.

#### Business Verification

Business Verification analyzes, verifies and provides data intelligence for business entities in 83 countries. During Customer Due Diligence, Business Verification assists clients to automate compliance workflows, reduce manual front-to- back office operations, take advantage of digital processes, decrease the risk of fraud, and allow staff to focus on key compliance considerations.

#### AML Watchlist

Global AML Watchlist helps your business comply with domestic and international AML, CTF and sanctions enforcement regulations. The watchlist covers sanction lists, law enforcements lists and governing regulatory bodies from around the world.
## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:
1. Java 1.7+
2. Maven/Gradle

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

### Maven users

Add this dependency to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.trulioo</groupId>
  <artifactId>normalizedapi</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.4</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
compile "com.trulioo:normalizedapi:1.0.4"
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

* `target/normalizedapi-1.0.4.jar`
* `target/lib/*.jar`

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

import com.trulioo.normalizedapi.*;
import com.trulioo.normalizedapi.api.*;
import com.trulioo.normalizedapi.model.*;

//Set client here
ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient();
apiClient.setUsername("-- USER NAME --");
apiClient.setPassword("-- PASSWORD --");

//ConnectionApi
ConnectionApi connectionClient = new ConnectionApi(apiClient);

//testAuthentication
String testResult = connectionClient.testAuthentication();
System.out.println(testResult);

//testAuthenticationAsync
connectionClient.testAuthenticationAsync(new ApiCallback<String>() {
	@Override
	public void onFailure(ApiException ae, int i, Map<String, List<String>> map) {
		Logger.getLogger(SdkJavaV1Sample.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ae);
	}

	@Override
	public void onSuccess(String t, int i, Map<String, List<String>> map) {
		System.out.println(t);
	}

	@Override
	public void onUploadProgress(long l, long l1, boolean bln) {
		//To change body of generated methods, choose Tools | Templates.
	}

	@Override
	public void onDownloadProgress(long l, long l1, boolean bln) {
		//To change body of generated methods, choose Tools | Templates.
	}
});

```

Class | Method | HTTP request | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
*BusinessApi* | [**getBusinessSearchResult**](docs/BusinessApi.md#getBusinessSearchResult) | **GET** /business/v1/search/transactionrecord/{id} | returns the a business search result.
*BusinessApi* | [**search**](docs/BusinessApi.md#search) | **POST** /business/v1/search | Calling this method will perform a business search.
*ConfigurationApi* | [**getConsents**](docs/ConfigurationApi.md#getConsents) | **GET** /configuration/v1/consents/{configurationName}/{countryCode} | This method retrieves the consents required for data sources currently configured in your account configuration.   The response for this method contains a collection of strings that Verify method&#39;s ConsentForDataSources field expects to perform a verification using those data sources.   A failure to provide an element from the string collection will lead to a &lt;a class&#x3D;\&quot;link-to-api\&quot; href&#x3D;\&quot;#errors\&quot;&gt;1005&lt;/a&gt; service error.
